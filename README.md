# ZZT Toolbox

This is my personal toolbox of various ZZT things.

## boardwalk

Walks over a .ZZT file, trying to detect irregularities. Used for recovering corrupt worlds by hand. Edit the source code for configuration 
options.

## mml2zzt

Converts .MML files ("Modern MML"/"Mabinogi" format) to ZZT sound code.
