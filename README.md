# ZZT Toolbox

This is my personal toolbox of various ZZT things.

## boardwalk

Walks over a .ZZT file, trying to detect irregularities. Used for recovering corrupt worlds by hand. Edit the source code for configuration 
options.

## ezzt_cer_unpack

Simple tool to unpack ZZT Enhancer .CER files. A text file is included, documenting the format 
findings so far.

## mml2zzt

Converts .MML files ("Modern MML"/"Mabinogi" format) to ZZT sound code.

## world_join

Quick Zookeeper-based script to concatenate ZZT worlds.

## zgraph

Graph generator/calculator for ZZT worlds. Requires NetworkX and pygraphviz.
Work in progress.
